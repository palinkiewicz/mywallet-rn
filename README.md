# myWallet (React Native) - Discontinued

> I decided to discontinue this project as I found React Native too slow and unstable.
>
> The project was meant to teach me how to develop React Native apps and use Google Firebase.
>
> This was initially the first bigger project that came to mind back in 2017, when I was learning HTML, CSS, and JS and just discovered Cordova.
>
> The Cordova version of the project is available on GitLab: [myWallet](https://gitlab.com/DakilPL/mywallet).

## Functionality

App's purpose is to help people with managing and tracking money they spend. The app was meant to be especially useful for teenagers who don't have a bank account as I was relatively young at the time this first came to mind.

I wanted this app to have functionalities such as different currencies, a currency exchange calculator, debt tracking, money spent/earned statistics, and many more.
What the app is capable of at the moment, nonetheless, is only tracking profit and loss on different accounts and displaying a history of them.

## Future plans

I am no longer willing to continue this project due to my experiences with React Native's stability and speed.
However, I may want to recreate the project in some other technologies or languages since it has a huge educational (and sentimental) value.
